# Weather-Journal
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. It is an implementation of the client-side server-side concept. 
The client-side is responsible for manipulating the DOM according to the data it gets from the server.
The server side is responsible for gathering data posted from the user and obtained from the Open Weather API. It acts as a data endpoint.
